# Detecting-Patterns-of-Speciation-in-the-Fossil-Record
 This data science project analyzes patterns of mammalian speciation over time and space using data from the NOW (New and Old Worlds) fossil database. The goal is to identify "species factories" - specific times and places that gave rise to exceptionally high numbers of new species during mammalian evolution.
